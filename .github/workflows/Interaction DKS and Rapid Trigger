name: Bind key whenever Rapid Trigger turns into red (deactivates the key)
About: 
The moment in which Rapid Trigger deactivates (key turns into red) and then write another bind when that event happens. Kind of like DKS but instead of fixed 1.5. mm release, using the deactivation point of Rapid Trigger
Whenever Rapid Trigger deactivates, i want to send the opposite input of movement key for counter strafing.
Example:
Like: A... Deactivates RT... send D .

labels: enhancement, interaction DKS and Rapid Trigger.
